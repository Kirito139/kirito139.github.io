    <p>Hello! My name's Lennier.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a student at Lowell HS in San Francisco, where I've been taking the advanced math track,
    as well as courses in Physics and Computer Science. I'm co-lead of Operations at <a
        href="https://www.flightclubaerospace.com/">Flight Club Aerospace</a>, a student-run
    nonprofit building an FAA-compliant ultralight aircraft from scratch.</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing the guitar, reading hard SF/hard fantasy novels, mountain biking, running, and
    programming.</p>
    <p>I'm a member of <a href="https://www.hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit
    organization helping teens fall in love with computers and electronics. They've helped me build
    some pretty cool things, like <a href="https://github.com/Kirito139/earthscii">a 3d map viewer
        for the terminal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jamdotjar/splotch">a cheap dual-arm SCARA
        plotter</a>!</p>
    <p>Recently, I joined <a
        href="https://www.team10221.org/"a>#1 Sea Bass</a> (FIRST Robotics Competition team #10221)
    as their main subsytems programmer and business lead, and I'm learning so much about robotics
    and engineering! Good luck to all the other teams in REBUILT, this season will be fun.
